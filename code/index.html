                            <p>A strong password is one that‚Äôs either not easily guessed or not easily brute forced. To make it not easily guessed it can‚Äôt be a simple word, to make it not easily cracked it needs to be long and complex. Super computers can go through billions of attempts per second to guess a password. Try to make your passwords a minimum of 14 characters.</p>

                            <p>A passphrase is simply a password, that‚Äôs longer, it could be a sentence, with spaces and punctuation in it. The benefit of a passphrase is that typically they‚Äôre easier to remember, but more difficult to crack due to their length.</p>
                            <p>For every additional character in the length of a password or passphrase, the time it would take to break increases exponentially.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately that means that having a long password or passphrase can make you far more secure than having a short one with some symbols or numbers in it.</p>
